 **SecureVote** – Intelligent Backend Architecture (with DSA-Driven Optimization)
 Overview

The _SecureVote_ Backend is built with **Spring Boot (Java)** and designed to handle highly concurrent, secure, and large-scale election systems — ensuring millions of users can cast votes seamlessly and safely.
The application emphasizes _clean architecture_, **thread-safe operations**, and DSA-driven optimization for high-performance data management.

This repository represents the **core backend logic**, where future integrations of **advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) will enhance system efficiency**, scalability, and fault tolerance.

 **Key Highlights**

___Spring Boot 3+, JPA/Hibernate, REST APIs

Role-based authentication (planned)

Audit Logging for all critical actions (implemented)

Transaction Safety using @Transactional

Concurrency-Ready Vote Casting

Custom Exception Handling & Validation

Modular Service Layer Architecture___

Future: DSA-Driven Backend Enhancements
(For caching, ranking, duplicate prevention, and efficient data lookup)
